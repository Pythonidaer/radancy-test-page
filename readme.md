# Code Challenge README

## Project Description

For this project, I adhered to using only Vanilla CSS 3 and HTML 5 to build and style web pages. Post submission, I plan to study Sass, but wanted to submit this in a timely fashion.

## Development Notes

- **Technology Stack:** The project is primarily built using Vanilla CSS 3 for styling and HTML 5 for structuring web pages. In particular, I utilized Flexbox, CSS Grid, and the <picture> syntax, for responsive images.

- **Image Assets:** To access image assets, I needed to install Gimp. This allowed me to work with the .psd (Photoshop) files and export images.

- **Hidden Layers:** During the process of working with .psd files, I noticed the presence of additional hidden layers in the design. I did not re-design the website with those in mind as it was unclear as to where I should be using them.

- **Lighthouse:** Usage of Google Chrome's Lighthouse tool will lead to subsequent improvements in SEO and Accessibility prior to final submission.

## Future Plans

- Study Sass to improve my CSS workflow and maintainability.
- Await feedback and next steps in the interviewing process.

This README will be updated as the project progresses and new insights are gained.

Thank you for this opportunity!
